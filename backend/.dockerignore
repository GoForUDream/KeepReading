# ============================================
# Backend .dockerignore
# ============================================
# Similar to .gitignore but for Docker builds
# Files/folders listed here won't be copied to the Docker image

# WHAT: Ignore node_modules
# WHY: We'll install fresh dependencies in the container
#      Copying existing node_modules is:
#      - Slow (lots of files)
#      - Wrong (may be for different OS - Mac vs Linux)
#      - Wasteful (we'll install anyway)
node_modules

# WHAT: Ignore npm logs
# WHY: Don't need debug logs in production container
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# WHAT: Ignore build output
# WHY: We'll build inside the container (in Dockerfile)
#      Don't want old builds from your Mac
dist
build

# WHAT: Ignore environment files
# WHY: Security - don't hardcode secrets in image
#      We'll provide .env at runtime via docker-compose
.env
.env.*

# WHAT: Ignore git files
# WHY: Don't need git history in production container
.git
.gitignore

# WHAT: Ignore test files
# WHY: Don't need tests in production image
#      (If you have tests, add them here)
*.test.ts
*.spec.ts
__tests__
coverage

# WHAT: Ignore IDE files
# WHY: VS Code settings aren't needed in container
.vscode
.idea
*.swp
*.swo

# WHAT: Ignore Docker files
# WHY: Don't need Dockerfile inside the container
Dockerfile
.dockerignore

# WHAT: Ignore README
# WHY: Documentation not needed at runtime
README.md

# WHAT: Ignore Prisma migrations during build
# WHY: We'll run migrations separately with docker-compose
#      Migrations should run AFTER container starts
# NOTE: We DO copy prisma/schema.prisma (needed for Prisma Client)
prisma/migrations
